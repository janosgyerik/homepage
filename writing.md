    <p>My book on <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">Bazaar, the distributed version control system</a> was published in June, 2013 by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/bazaar-version-control/book">Packt Publishing</a>.</p>

    <p>The book is a step-by-step tutorial for beginner to intermediate software developers who want to get started with Bazaar quickly.</p>

    <p>
The book walks you through the principles,
basic and advanced operations of version control.
It takes a step-by-step approach,
covering increasingly complex topics and situations of collaboration.
Packed with examples,
the book aims to give you a thorough understanding of version control with Bazaar,
and get you fully comfortable using this powerful,
highly intuitive and consistent tool,
in any project and workflow thrown at you.
    </p>

    <p>The sample chapter (Chapter 2: Diving into Bazaar) is a FREE download on the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/bazaar-version-control/book">publisherâ€™s website</a>.
    It includes the preface,
    which is a nice,
    short and sweet introduction of the book.
    The chapter reveals quite a lot:
    it explains all the basic operations of Bazaar using both the command line client and Bazaar Explorer.
    It is a good sample of the overall writing style in the book,
    and you should definitely read this first before buying.
    </p>

    <p><em>
    If you find the cover familiar,
    it is based on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">Gource</a>,
    a truly awesome VCS visualization tool that works transparently with Bazaar.
