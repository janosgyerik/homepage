I like to code and I do it a lot.
I want to work for green energy or health, eventually.
I'm deeply worried about these fields,
and I believe that great software could really make a big difference.
I work on private and open-source projects in my spare time.
If you want to join forces, drop me a line!

- [Apps](apps.html) ---
  Simple but practical Android apps.

- [Websites](websites.html) ---
  Simple but practical websites.

- [Writing](writing.html) ---
  My professional writings published here and there.

- I tweet as [@janosgyerik](https://twitter.com/janosgyerik) and [@bashoneliners](https://twitter.com/bashoneliners).

- I blog on http://janosgyerik.com/blog.html

      Not really personal,
      this is really my *journal of daily hacks*:
      When I figure out something sort of tricky,
      I write it down so I don't have to research it again.
      I also post new releases of my apps and websites here.

- GitHub --- https://github.com/janosgyerik

      My recent open-source work is hosted on GitHub.

- Stack Exchange --- [janos](http://stackexchange.com/users/322516)

      I answer questions quite actively on Stack Exchange sites,
      especially on
      [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/12390/janos),
      where I'm an elected moderator since 2015 September.
      I also chase rep semi-regularly on
      [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/641955/janos).

- Careers 2.0 --- http://careers.stackoverflow.com/janosgyerik

      My profile on Careers 2.0 by stackoverflow.
      More detailed than a [LinkedIn](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/janosgyerik/) profile,
      and more relevant for software engineers,
      highlighting open source projects, Stack Exchange answers,
      publications, and others.

- Coderwall --- https://coderwall.com/janosgyerik

      Sometimes (less and less)
      I publish ["Pro Tips"](https://coderwall.com/p/u/janosgyerik) on this site.

### Old stuff

I don't use these much anymore.
In fact I'm migrating some of this stuff elsewhere.
That said, I still want to make a note here,
at least to keep as bookmarks for myself...

- Wiki --- http://wiki.titan2x.com/

    My personal reference of all things related to computers,
    programming, operating systems (especially GNU/Linux) and databases.
    A lot of cheat sheets,
    some in-depth articles and how to guides of larger topics.

- Launchpad -- https://launchpad.net/~janos-gyerik

    My not so recent work is hosted on Launchpad,
    a Bazaar repository hosting site.
