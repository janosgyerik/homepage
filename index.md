I like to code and I do it a lot.
I want to work for green energy or health, eventually.
I'm deeply worried about these fields,
and I believe that great software could really make a big difference.
I work on private and open-source projects in my spare time.

- [Apps](apps.html) ---
  Simple but practical Android apps.

  Simple but practical websites.

- [Writing](writing.html) ---
  Various writings published here and there.

- Twitter --- I tweet as [@janosgyerik](https://twitter.com/janosgyerik) and [@bashoneliners](https://twitter.com/bashoneliners).

- Blog --- http://blog.janosgyerik.com/

  Sort of a blog,
  this is really my *journal of daily hacks*.
  I don't like to research the same problem twice,
  so when I figure out something,
  I write it down here quickly for future reference.
  I also post new releases of my apps and websites here,
  so it's a good way to follow what I'm up to.

- Wiki --- http://wiki.titan2x.com/

  My personal reference of all things related to computers,
  programming, operating systems (especially GNU/Linux) and databases.
  A lot of cheat sheets,
  some in-depth articles and how to guides of larger topics.
