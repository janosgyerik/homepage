I like to code and I do it a lot.
I want to work in green energy or health someday.
I believe that great software could make a big difference, everywhere, always.
I'm passionate about high quality software, domain driven design, and agile.

I run [bashonerliners.com](https://www.bashoneliners.com),
a collection of high-quality Bash one-liners and snippets with detailed explanations.
I regularly tweet all new one-liners that land on the site.

- LinkedIn --- [@janosgyerik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janosgyerik/)

  I'm not really active here, and I only connect with people I actually know.

- Twitter --- [@janosgyerik](https://twitter.com/janosgyerik)

  This is my personal account, the best place to reach out to me and start a conversation.
  I rarely tweet, only when I see something truly compelling to share.

- Stack Exchange --- [@janos](http://stackexchange.com/users/322516)

  I used to be active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/641955/janos) (100k+)
  and even more on [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/12390/janos) (100k+),
  where I used to be an elected moderator in 2015-2018.

- GitHub --- [@janosgyerik](https://github.com/janosgyerik)

  I share most of my code openly, because why not. Some have a few-hundred stars, but nothing major.

- Codementor --- [@janosgyerik](https://www.codementor.io/@janosgyerik?refer=homepage)

  I'm not really active here anymore.
  I used to help programmers with programming and devops questions in one-on-one mentoring sessions.

- Blog --- [http://janosgyerik.com/blog](http://janosgyerik.com/blog)

  This is my *journal of daily hacks*, a generally very impersonal and dry blog.
  When I figure out how to do something a bit tricky,
  I write it down so I don't have to re-research it again and again.
