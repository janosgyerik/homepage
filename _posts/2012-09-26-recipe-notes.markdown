A simple Android app. If you like cooking and collecting recipes of delicious dishes that you actually eat, this app is for you. Entering recipes is usually a lot of work. This app aims to minimize that effort, especially typing, so that you can note down all the delicious dishes you eat with photos as easily as possible.
