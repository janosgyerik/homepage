I'm still keeping Opera around for the bookmarks, and synchronization. But for "regular" use I'm switching back to Firefox. It's really too bad it did not work out. I had a lot of problems.
<ul>
	<li>On Windows, from time to time, it uses CPU 100%</li>
	<li>On MAC, I cannot type in Japanese properly... Weird...</li>
	<li>On MAC, but might be on others too, Google API doc pages are broken. WTF? If pages full of JavaScript stuff break down that's not really surprising, but API doc pages?</li>
	<li>A lot of rich text editors are not usable, on many many websites.</li>
	<li>Many other strange issues that you don't notice at first but become very much annoying after regular use...</li>
</ul>
Too bad too bad. I like to support the "little guys" every once in a while but Opera has become a productivity issue for me.
