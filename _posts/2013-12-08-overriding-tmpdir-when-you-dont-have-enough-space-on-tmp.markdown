Sometimes you might not have enough disk space on the `/tmp` directory but need it badly. For example when creating a `deb` package from a Java tarball in Debian using `make-jpkg`, there's no command line parameter or any other apparent means to specify an alternative working directory for temporary files.

Check-mate? Luckily, no! I could force a different directory using the `TMPDIR` environment variable like this:
<pre>TMPDIR=/some/where make-jpkg Â jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz</pre>
