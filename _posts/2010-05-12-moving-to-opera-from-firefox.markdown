A colleague recommended Opera over Firefox. The main reason for me to switch was the built-in bookmark synchronization and mouse gestures. And they are truly great.

But...

I have quite a lot of problems with Opera, some of them very surprising.

- Some WYSIWYG editors don't work well, or at all
- When the focus is on a checkbox in a form, pressing enter checks/unchecks instead of sending the form
- No RikaiChan plugin
- No Live Bookmarks

That said, if the bookmark synchronization works without problems as expected, I'll probably still stick with Opera, as that is huge to me.
