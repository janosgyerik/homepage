I remember when I tried Opera I was bitching a LOT about it...

I've been using Chrome for about a week now, and it's totally awesome, and truly faster than anything else. Even though I quite regularly bump into very much noticeable and ugly bugs, they don't make a difference at all, I'm still fully satisfied. Damn I should have switched a long time ago...
