By default, Android loses wifi connection approximately 15 minutes after the screen turns off.

To change this, go to Settings / Wireless controls / Wi-Fi settings, then press the <strong>menu</strong> button, choose Advanced, and then Wi-Fi sleep policy.

This is on HT-03A, also known as HTC Magic.
