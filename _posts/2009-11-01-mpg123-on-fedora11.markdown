I needed `mpg123` to burn an audio CD with cdrecord on my Fedora 11 system at home. Since it's not in Fedora's standard repos, googled for it, and found this.

So far so good, I just needed a few more libraries as dependencies, however, the package names were not really intuitive.

- libartsc - arts
- libaudio - nas-libs
- libportaudio - portaudio

It was mere luck that first I looked for `libportaudio`, and tried simply "portaudio" for little logical reason. Following the same package naming logic I could find "arts". Finally found "nas-libs" with google.
