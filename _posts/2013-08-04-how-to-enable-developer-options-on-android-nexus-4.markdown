I spent a couple of long minutes looking for the developer menu on my shiny new Nexus 4. I was looking for the options normally called <strong>USB debugging</strong> and <strong>Stay awake</strong>, normally under <strong>Applications / Development</strong>. I could not find them anywhere on this otherwise beautiful piece. Strangely, the menu is disabled by default. You can enable by following these steps:
<ul>
	<li>Open your phone settings---swipe down on the phone, click on the button in the top-right corner, click <strong>Settings</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>About phone</strong>, it's at the bottom</li>
	<li>Click on <strong>Build number</strong>, 7 times (!!!), it's at the bottom</li>
</ul>
What the hell... Who would have known? After this the <strong>Developer options</strong> menu becomes available, right next <strong>About phone</strong>.

I found the tip here:
