I spent a couple of long minutes looking for the developer menu on my shiny new Nexus 4. I was looking for the options normally called USB debugging and Stay awake, normally under Applications / Development. I could not find them anywhere on this otherwise beautiful piece. Strangely, the menu is disabled by default. You can enable by following these steps:

- Open your phone settings---swipe down on the phone, click on the button in the top-right corner, click Settings
- Click About phone, it's at the bottom
- Click on Build number, 7 times (!!!), it's at the bottom

What the hell... Who would have known? After this the Developer options menu becomes available, right next About phone.

I found the tip here:
