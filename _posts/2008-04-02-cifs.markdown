Recently we installed a network drive. I mounted it as <tt>smbfs</tt> from a Linux system, but strangely after about an hour the mount fell apart and started to give me IO errors. An umount/mount temporarily fixed the problem but only for another hour.

Then I got this tip to mount it as <tt>cifs</tt>. Worked fantastic hurray!
