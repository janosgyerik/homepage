I put together this simple presentation about a few simple but very effective practical tips that should make you lightning fast on the command line. I use these literally every minute I spend in the shell. All the tips should work in Linux, UNIX, BSD and similar.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="c60847a09dbc0130f65c42af66aab503" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

- I used many tips from [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) to "design" the slides.
- I created the presentation using Google Docs, but it was not really a great experience:

	- The dotted green line you see under headings is not intentional, it appears only after exporting to PDF. I don't know why. I would prefer it without the line as shown correctly in [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13N06QfsemvTFiQLF5nC-eatlktmj5DMFAzxexwJ8TgA/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"](Google's viewer), but I want to use Speaker Deck as it is not blocked at my workplace and has a better WordPress plugin.
	- The JavaScript seems to go crazy in the presentation editor. The longer I use it, the heavier it gets, until I do a clean fresh reload.

- I used the [Speaker Deck Embed](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/speakerdeck-embed/) plugin to embed the presentation here. Oh and Speaker Deck is really awesome.
