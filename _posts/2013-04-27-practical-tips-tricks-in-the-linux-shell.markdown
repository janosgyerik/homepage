I put together this simple presentation about a few simple but very effective practical tips that should make you lightning fast on the command line. I use these literally every minute I spend in the shell. All the tips should work in Linux, UNIX, BSD and similar.

<ul>
	<li>I used many tips from <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/">Zach Holman's blog</a> to "design" the slides.</li>
	<li>I created the presentation using Google Docs, but it was not really a great experience:
<ul>
	<li>The dotted green line you see under headings is not intentional, it appears only after exporting to PDF. I don't know why. I would prefer it without the line as shown correctly in <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13N06QfsemvTFiQLF5nC-eatlktmj5DMFAzxexwJ8TgA/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">Google's viewer</a>, but I want to use Speaker Deck as it is not blocked at my workplace and has a better WordPress plugin.</li>
	<li>The JavaScript seems to go crazy in the presentation editor. The longer I use it, the heavier it gets, until I do a clean fresh reload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I used the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/speakerdeck-embed/">Speaker Deck Embed</a> plugin to embed the presentation here. Oh and Speaker Deck is really awesome.</li>
</ul>
