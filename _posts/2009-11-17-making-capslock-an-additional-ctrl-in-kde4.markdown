On most keyboards the CapsLock is at the perfect location for a Control key, something I use much more often, so the first thing I do after installing a new system is remap CapsLock to be a Control key instead.

I had a hard time finding this option in KDE4.

It's in *System Settings / Regional & Language*

It would have been more intuitive in *Keyboard & Mouse* ...
