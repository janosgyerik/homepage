Sometimes Eclipse really sucks. Today I wanted to upgrade my subversion plugin and ended up wasting a lot of time on it.

How to upgrade a plugin in Eclipse?
<ul>
	<li><strong>Help / Check for Updates</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>This will scan all your plugins, taking a long time, when I want to upgrade one specific plugin</li>
	<li>In this case it's also pointless (as I found out later), as the Subversion plugins are on separate upgrade sites per version (different site for 1.6, 1.8, etc)</li>
</ul>
	<li><strong>Help / Install New Software</strong></li>
<ul>
	<li>It seems this is the way to go, but why so non-intuitive name?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Well this didn't work. I got all kinds of errors that didn't make much sense:
<ul>
	<li>"Cannot install XYZ plugin because it already exists. Upgrading instead."</li>
<ul>
	<li>Except it could not upgrade, due to some conflicts in dependencies which again, didn't make much sense.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Next I tried uninstalling all Subclipse related plugins to resolve the conflicts.</li>
<ul>
	<li>The uninstall seems to work successfully, but when I try again the install, it still complains that XYZ plugin is still installed.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Next I tried removing all the files in ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins that seem related.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Then I get stuck when downloading the new jars,Â "read timed out"</li>
<ul>
	<li>... despite the fact that I can download those files in a browser</li>
	<li>... despite the fact that some of the mentioned files are already downloaded in the plugins directory</li>
	<li>... same result even if I manually download the jars and put them in plugins directory</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
The final solution was to download the ZIP file from the Subclipse site and install locally, from here:

<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA">http://subclipse.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=p4wYuA</a>

Eclipse is (usually) pretty great. If only they could iron out these kind of issues already. They existed for as long as I can remember...
