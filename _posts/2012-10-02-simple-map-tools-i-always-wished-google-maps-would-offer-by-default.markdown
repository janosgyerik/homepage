I made something. A very simple map tool, built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/), to implement some functionality I always wished Google Maps would offer by default, such as:

- Jump to a specific latitude-longitude
- What is the latitude-longitude of a location?
- What are the coordinates of the bounding box of a given view?
- What are the coordinates of a given address?
- What is the address at given coordinates?
- What is the current zoom level?

These (and a bit more) are the current features of the tool. More will come, for example:

- Show places based on a Google Docs spreadsheet
- Save place coordinates and address into a Google Docs spreadsheet
- *Pin* selected search results, so they are not removed when doing a new search
