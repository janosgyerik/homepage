I made something. A very simple map tool, built with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/), to implement some functionality I always wished Google Maps would offer by default, such as:
<ul>
	<li>Jump to a specific latitude-longitude</li>
	<li>What is the latitude-longitude of a location?</li>
	<li>What are the coordinates of the bounding box of a given view?</li>
	<li>What are the coordinates of a given address?</li>
	<li>What is the address at given coordinates?</li>
	<li>What is the current zoom level?</li>
</ul>
These (and a bit more) are the current features of the tool. More will come, for example:

<ul>
	<li>Show places based on a Google Docs spreadsheet</li>
	<li>Save place coordinates and address into a Google Docs spreadsheet</li>
	<li>"Pin" selected search results, so they are not removed when doing a new search</li>
</ul>
