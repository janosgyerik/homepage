[@stripe](https://twitter.com/stripe) is organizing [Capture The Flag 3](https://stripe.com/blog/ctf3-coming-soon),
an online competition for programmers.
Their first two challenges were practically hacking contests.
But this time it seems they will focus more on distributed systems engineering,
fault-tolerance and performance.
I don't know how exactly, but we'll all find out soon enough.
The contest will start on Wednesday,
at [11am San Francisco, 7pm London, 6am Melbourne](https://stripe-ctf.com/countdown).

If it's anything like the first two contests,
it's going to be an exciting and extremely valuable experience for programmers of all levels.
You can sharpen your coding and problem solving skills.
Even if you're not a security expert or penetration tester,
you should be able to get through at least half of the levels,
and I guarantee that you will emerge enlightened,
wiser,
and become a safer, better coder in the future.

So dust off your black hats,
and clear your schedules for the 2nd half of the week.
As preparation,
maybe,
it might help to redo the 6 levels of the first contest as an exercise,
[using this live CD](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctfomatic/files/).
(Judging by the download stats,
it looks like some folks are already doing it...)
