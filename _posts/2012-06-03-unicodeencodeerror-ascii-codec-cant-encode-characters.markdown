When coding in python, I've been hit by the following error every once in a while:
<pre>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 25-28: ordinal not in range(128)</pre>
Today I finally figured why:
<pre>$ python -c 'import sys; print sys.stdout.encoding'
$ US-ASCII</pre>
Although my terminal application is capable of outputting unicode characters, python (2.6) somehow does not know it, and tries to output everything in `ascii`, hence the error. The solution is to set `PYTHONIOENCODING` in my ~/.bashrc:
<pre>export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8</pre>
