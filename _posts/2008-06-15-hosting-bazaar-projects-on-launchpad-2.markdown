Wow. Actually, you don't need to go through all that stuff I wrote in the last post. If you have a Launchpad account, and configured SSH public keys, you can simply push to Launchpad, anywhere! Like this:

<blockquote>bzr push lp:~janos-gyerik/scripts/software-cache</blockquote><br />

It takes a while for Launchpad to pick up the changes. So wait a little, and then you can fill in project details.
