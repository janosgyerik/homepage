[TED][1] is on its usual summer holiday.
So instead of getting my regular daily dose,
it's a good time to discover great past talks,
for example this playlist of [the 20 most popular talks of all time][2].

And if that's not enough,
here's a bunch of my favorite TED talks,
not too old, not too new:

- [The investment logic for sustainability][3]

    Companies that place high value on environmental,
    social and governance concerns are already very successful.
    It makes sense to prefer investing in such companies.

- [Demo: A needle-free vaccine patch that's safer and way cheaper][6]

    Vaccination by needles is old-fashioned and dangerous.
    But there's a better way.

- [As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify][5]

    6 simple rules to get your employees engaged.

- [The magic of Fibonacci numbers][8]

    Fibonacci numbers are awesome,
    they are everywhere,
    and they can be presented in a funny way.

- [How to make stress your friend][10]

    Apparently stress only kills you *if you think* it does.
    But you can turn the table around!

- [The game that can give you 10 extra years of life][7]

    A moving talk, that might help you live longer,
    if you could just follow a few really simple steps every day.

- [The art of misdirection][11]

    Watch the greatest pickpocket in the world in action.

- [Anatomy of a New Yorker cartoon][14]

    Funny cartoons from the New Yorker,
    presented by the funny guy in charge of selecting them.

- [The polyphonic me][15]

    Funny British dude making groovy tunes.
