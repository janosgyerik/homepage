BluetoothViewer is a simple Android application that can connect to any Bluetooth device and display incoming raw data, and can also send data from Android to the Bluetooth device. The purpose of the application is to confirm that a Bluetooth device is online and discoverable, accepting incoming connections, and to observe the raw data messages coming from the device.

We use this as a debugging tool for portable environmental sensors that can transmit data over Bluetooth. Naturally it can be useful to debug any kind of Bluetooth device.

The application is FREE and open-source, contributions are very much welcome. For more details see the project homepage:

By the way, publishing on Android Market was really a smooth ride. After publishing, the app's page on the Market website was ready in a couple of minutes, and after a few hours I was able to find it using the Market application on my Android phone. Totally awesome!
