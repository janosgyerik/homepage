It always annoys me when Chrome tries to open a PDF within the browser.
Usually I have it setup to not do that,
but every once in a while I change environments,
or Chrome upgrades itself,
and so my settings either get lost,
or just simply stop working and I have to research again.

The solution is simple, visit this link:

[chrome://plugins/](chrome://plugins/)

and disable **Chrome PDF Viewer**. Hurray.
