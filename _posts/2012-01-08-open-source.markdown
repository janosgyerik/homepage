You can find my open-source work on one of these code hosting sites. Most of the projects are small though, I highlight the most relevant ones on the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page. If something catches your eye, drop me a line and maybe we can work on something together.
<h2>GitHub -- <a href="https://github.com/janosgyerik">https://github.com/janosgyerik</a></h2>
These projects are managed with Git, obviously.
<h2>Launchpad -- <a href="https://launchpad.net/~janos-gyerik/+related-projects">https://launchpad.net/~janos-gyerik/+related-projects</a></h2>
These projects are managed with Bazaar.
