Today I went on a Firefox extension try-out rampage and selected a dozen good looking extensions. I didn't restart Firefox during this, I thought I'll just restart once in the end instead of every time. It didn't work, and restart did nothing. A tip suggested to delete extensions.{cache,rdf,ini} files, but that didn't cut it, and I had to hunt down those extensions again.

The lesson: next time either install one by one or in smaller chunks.
