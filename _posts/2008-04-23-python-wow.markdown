I'm learning Python now. Beautiful syntax. Powerfully expressive, and that in an intuitive way. Being a seasoned programmer well-versed in a score of languages I looked down at the idea of reading tutorials, but the Python tutorial turned out to be a very interesting reading, and definitely the best starting point. Check it out!
