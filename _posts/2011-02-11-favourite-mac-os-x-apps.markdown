- Google Chrome
- Quicksilver - launcher, the first app I install always, and then some tweaking:

	- Disable spotlight
	- Automatically start Quicksilver on login (System Preferences / Accounts / Login items)
	- Map Quicksilver launcher to Cmd - Space

- iTerm - terminal application, much better than the default terminal, for example it has tabs
- MacVim
- Bazaar - version control
- VLC - media player
- Calibre - kindle manager
- DigitalColor Meter - (installed by default) a color picket tool, simple and perfect
- Mac Ports (takes some time to install) - to install UNIX software
- Freemind - mind mapping tool
- picasamac
- sshfs - mount remote filesystems over ssh
