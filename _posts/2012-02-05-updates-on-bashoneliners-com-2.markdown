	<li>Revised and improved the formatting of all pages.</li>
	<li>Added 'Accept this answer' button to proposed answers.</li>
	<li>Now your can preview Explanations and Limitations fields when posting or editing a one-liner.</li>
	<li>Added 'Post an alternative one-liner' button, so if you know a better one-liner, you can post it and relate it to the original one.</li>

Not my most relaxing weekend, but hopefully it was worth it!
