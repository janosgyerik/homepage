- Migrated to Bootstrap 2 from Twitter. Thanks to that the site is now readable on mobile devices, with fluid flowing text.
- Revised and improved the formatting of all pages.
- Added **Accept this answer** button to proposed answers.
- Now your can preview Explanations and Limitations fields when posting or editing a one-liner.
- Added **Post an alternative one-liner** button, so if you know a better one-liner, you can post it and relate it to the original one.

Not my most relaxing weekend, but hopefully it was worth it!
