    Nahát, mik vannak, ha 5 éve tudomásom van rólad, még akár dolgozhatunk volna is együtt, persze eztán sem kizárt... ;) (Örs)

I like to code and I do it a lot. I would like to work for the benefit of green energy or health, eventually. I am very concerned about these fields and I believe that great software could really help a lot and make a big difference.

I am always interested in working on cool projects. If you'd like to work on something together, drop me a line! You can read about my current and past personal projects in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab, a mix of open-source and closed source work.
<h3>Blog -- <a href="http://blog.janosgyerik.com/">http://blog.janosgyerik.com/</a></h3>
I keep a journal of <em>"daily hacks"</em>, so I don't have to research and solve the same problem twice. I also make release announcements here of my personal projects, so it's an easy way to follow what I'm up to at the moment. Except my <em>secret</em> projects for world domination of course.
<h3>Wiki -- <a href="http://wiki.titan2x.com/">http://wiki.titan2x.com/</a></h3>
My personal reference of all things related to computers, programming, operating systems (especially GNU/Linux) and databases. A lot of cheat sheets, occasionally in-depth articles and how to guides of broader subjects.
<h3>Launchpad -- <a href="https://launchpad.net/~janos-gyerik">https://launchpad.net/~janos-gyerik</a></h3>
My profile on Launchpad, a Bazaar hosting site. You can find some of my open-source projects there, as well as my contribution to other open-source projects.
<h3>GitHub -- <a href="https://github.com/janosgyerik">https://github.com/janosgyerik</a></h3>
My profile on GitHub, a Git hosting site. You can find some of my open-source projects there, as well as my contribution to other open-source projects.
<h3>Stack Exchange</h3>

Check out my network profile to see my activities on all the Stack Exchange sites. I am most active on <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/users/17433/janos">Unix and Linux</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/641955/janos">Stack Overflow</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/52610/janos">Programmers</a> and <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://askubuntu.com/users/23972/janos">Ask Ubuntu</a>.
<h3>Bazaar Version Control</h3>
My book on <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a>, the distributed version control system was published in June 2013. It's intended for anyone who may be new to version control systems. If you are a programmer or a system administrator, you can benefit greatly from using Bazaar in your projects. If you are already familiar with version control systems, this book should serve as a fast and easy way to understand Bazaar. You can download a sample chapter for free form the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/bazaar-version-control/book">publisher's website</a>.
