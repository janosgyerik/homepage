I wanted to enable user homepages in lighttpd in Fedora, that is, so that if you go to localhost/~myuser/ you can see the user's homepage which is in ~myuser/public_html directory.Â In many web servers it works like that by default, but inlighttpd in Fedora it does not. There is only one config file, `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf` and I searched through all options with `"user"` in them but nothing. Finally I looked at the settings on my Ubuntu box, and found the missing piece:
<blockquote>userdir.path = "public_html"</blockquote>
