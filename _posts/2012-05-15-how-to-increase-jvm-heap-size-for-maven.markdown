Do not edit mvn (or mvn.bat) itself.Â Add any necessary JVM arguments to the MAVEN_OPTS environment variable.
<pre>-Xmx512m</pre>
Depending on your environment, increasing the max heap may not be enough, you might get a different kind of OOM:
<pre>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space</pre>
The "PermGen space" is for storing information about the heap itself. The bigger the heap, the PermGen space also needs to be bigger, you can increase both like this:
<pre>-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m</pre>
