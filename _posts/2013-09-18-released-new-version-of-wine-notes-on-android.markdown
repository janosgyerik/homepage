The new version (1.1) of Wine Notes is now on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.winenotes.lite).

The new features:

- Fixed the broken EURO sign
- Now you can select the currency
- The last used currency becomes the default currency
- Wine names you enter are now automatically "title-ized"
- Changed to a bright theme in most dialog screens
- Replaced the text buttons with image buttons in tag editor dialogs
- Removed the pointless Quit menu option
- Many minor usability and ergonomic improvements

Check it out, I hope you'll enjoy!
