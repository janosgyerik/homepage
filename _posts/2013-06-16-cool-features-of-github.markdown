I put together a simple presentation about some of the amazing features of GitHub. I focus on stuff that can be very useful even for folks who might not know Git and GitHub very well, or not at all. The idea is that by starting to use GitHub, they just might actually get on the fast track to becoming full-time Git users, who knows...

It's a presentation, so the slides are not really designed for reading, but here they are anyway:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-9 col-xs-12">
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="567be1c0b8d4013000d47aa19dd2a8cb" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
    </div>
</div>

Once again, I used many tips from [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) to "design" the slides.
I also shamelessly borrowed colors and fonts from his other fantastic slides, especially [this one](https://speakerdeck.com/holman/unsucking-your-teams-development-environment). (I hope he wouldn't mind...)

I created the slides using Google Docs, and since it looks like the links didn't come out right in the PDF export, here they are:
