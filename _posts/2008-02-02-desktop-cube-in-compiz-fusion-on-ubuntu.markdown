I've been using Beryl for some time now, until Feisty, to be exact. To my surprise Gutsy no longer had packages for Beryl. Luckily it has Compiz. 

To access advanced settings such as the wonderful desktop cube, apt-get install <a href="compizconfig-settings-manager">compizconfig-settings-manager</a>. This will enable the menu option: System | Preferences | Advanced Desktop Effects Settings. 

Also notable that after enabling the desktop cube I was not able to switch between workspaces... For that I also needed to enable the rotate cube option. Spin away!
