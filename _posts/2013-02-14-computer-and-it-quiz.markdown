Recently I started contributing to this fun [Computer and IT Quiz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=quizHarness.quiz) app on Android:

[Mike Heyworth](http://spiderdogsandroidproject.blogspot.co.uk/) created the original app, I contributed mocks and elements for the new design, which Mike incorporated in the latest version of the app released just a few days ago. If you are in IT, do try it out, challenge yourself, test your skills, and just have fun with it!

If you like this FREE app please do buy the [PRO version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spiderdog.computeritquizpro) and support us!

More usability and design improvements will be coming soon (1-2 months), so stay tuned!
