It's very easy to take screenshots on a Mac.
If you know the right keys.
Which are not at all obvious.
And since I don't take screenshots regularly,
I tend to forget the magic keys.
Before I forget again, here they are:

- <kbd>Command-Shift-3</kbd>: take a screenshot of the entire screen and save it as a file on the desktop
- <kbd>Command-Shift-4</kbd>, then select an area: take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop
- <kbd>Command-Shift-4</kbd>, then space, then click a window: take a screenshot of a window and save it as a file on the desktop
- <kbd>Command-Control-Shift-3</kbd>: take a screenshot of the screen, and save it to the clipboard
- <kbd>Command-Control-Shift-4</kbd>, then select an area: take a screenshot of an area and save it to the clipboard
- <kbd>Command-Control-Shift-4</kbd>, then space, then click a window: take a screenshot of a window and save it to the clipboard

In Leopard and later, while selecting an area,
you can do more sophisticated things by holding down some keys:

- <kbd>Space</kbd>: hold down while selecting a region to lock the size of the region and move it with the mouse
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>: hold down while selecting a region to resize only one of the edges (horizontal or vertical)
- <kbd>Option</kbd>: hold down while selecting a region to resize with its center as the anchor point
