    Thanks, that's what I needed.

    Only note is i had to remove the hyphen from package name in last line so it read:

    sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2

libgtk-1.2 is very old and unmaintained software, and it has been removed from recent versions of Ubuntu and Debian. Read more here:

<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520441">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520441</a>

Unfortunately, lots of old games and other apps still depend on it. If you must, install it with:
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:adamkoczur/gtk1.2
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2</pre>
I needed this to install Darwinia, it seems it is also needed for Uplink and other games.
