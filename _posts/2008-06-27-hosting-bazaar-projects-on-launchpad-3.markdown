Adding to the previous posts...

Earlier I pushed one of my repositories to my Bazaar account like this:
<blockquote>bzr push lp:~janos-gyerik/scripts/software-cache</blockquote><br />

As a result of that, the following page got created too:
<a href="https://code.launchpad.net/scripts">https://code.launchpad.net/scripts</a>

At first I thought that's a little creepy. But well, it's good public exposure, I guess...
