Originally I wanted to title this post *"Things only Vim can do"*,
but since I obviously haven't tried all past/present/future editors,
I'll settle for this more humble name and show off some of the awesomeness of Vim.

For the time being,
I keep a running list of the sexiest features of Vim (order matters):

{% gist 8556496 %}

I'll round out these compact nodes into a full-blown article at some point.

Till then,
if you agree that Vim is wickedly awesome,
please support the proposal to create a [dedicated Q&A site for Vim on the Stack Exchange network][1].
