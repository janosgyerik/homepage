* Simplified the start screen, reduced clutter
* Now you can select question categories to include in a quiz
* Improved navigation: now you can easily return to the start screen after finishing a quiz
* New menu option to fade out unused wrong answers after the correct answer is revealed
* New menu option to reset all settings to default

This is the last release supporting old Android versions.
Starting from the next release, we will support only Android 4.0 and up.
