Published my first ever jQuery plugin just now: jQuery Upvote

http://plugins.jquery.com/upvote/

The plugin simply generates a voting widget like the one used on Stack Exchange sites:

- You can either upvote or downvote, not both at the same time
- You can cancel an upvote or downvote by clicking again
- The count is update accordingly
- You can star (= favorite) and unstar
- A callback method is fired on any update (upvote, downvote, star, and their reverse)

See it in action: http://janosgyerik.github.io/jquery-upvote/

Documentation: https://github.com/janosgyerik/jquery-upvote/blob/master/README.md

I've been needing this BADLY to add voting features on http://www.bashoneliners.com/. Hopefully that's coming soon too ;-)
